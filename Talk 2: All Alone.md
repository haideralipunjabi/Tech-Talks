# All Alone

I loved you with all of my heart, without the hope of love in return.

I dreamt of you everynight, knowing it's just for a while.

I loved you with all my might, though you escaped from my sight.

I saw you everytime I opened my eyes, knowing it's a dellusion of your beautiful eyes.

I loved you in a way I never loved, losing every last drop that remained.

I smiled on seeing your image, struck with the beauty of your glorious face.

I loved you with all of my heart, without the hope of love in return.

I let my soul free to find your's; Ah! such a dumb person I am, forgot that it will always be alone.
